# Boulder Dash Disassembly

This repo contains the data files and scripts used to generate my disassembly of the C64 version of the classic game Boulder Dash. The output of the latest incarnation can be found [here](http://www.retrointernals.org/boulder-dash/boulder-dash-disassembly.html). It's generated using a home-made disassembler (written in Python 3) I'm working on called (negentropy)[https://github.com/shewitt-au/negentropy]. It's also available in PIP.
